This is a full-stack project - a Todo List website built using Angular and Spring Boot! It was quite a challenge for me to deploy the project on GitHub Pages, as I had never used GitHub before. However, I learned a lot through this experience and am proud of what I've accomplished.

One of the most significant things I learned was how to use an in-memory database, which was something new for me. Throughout the project, I encountered many coding challenges, but I was able to overcome them through research and reading.
